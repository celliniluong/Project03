## Project 03: OneWay: A speculative Technology
#### by Cellini Luong


### Overview
My speculative technology is OneWay.

The year is 2028, the iPhone has become obsolete. Big Inc, a tech company, has found an intra-body solution to all digital functions that we once relied on our mobile devices for. With this new technology we are able to project all needed digital tools above the space of our palm. As the technology is deeply rooted in the core of our composition, it is highly responsive and to the biological processes in our body. 

This experience spans the boroughs of NYC. A location-focused prompt on what decisions you will make in this new state of the world. Throughout every decision, users will be able to see how much stress they are put under.

### Technical
In order to create this project, I used the p5.adventure and p5.clickables manager library to create a choose your adventure style experience. I used the p5.clickable library to create button interactions allowing users to make decisions in their journey as well as initiate the level of stress they have created for themselve. I used the p5.adventure library to create states and different question paths and outcomes depending on the users selections.
